# Endless Void
This repository contains the project file of the Endless Void level editor for Void Stranger, the UndertaleModTool script to merge it into the game (merger.csx), 
scripts to add and remove game assets from the project (located in the assetscripts folder), and patches applied to the game on-merge (/patches).
Very much a work-in-progress. Will eventually send data to a [Voyager](https://github.com/hexfae/voyager) server.

The project is set up like this, as opposed to just a plain UndertaleModTool mod, for several reasons:
- Much faster iteration
- When the game updates, it will be very easy to update with it
- Ability to use animation curves (in a non-painful way)
- Ability to use things that the UndertaleModTool compiler would usually not like
- Ability to open source the project (:

# Things to note about the code
- The project file was generated by GameMaker 2022.9.1.51 and should stay at that version, as Void Stranger was compiled with a 2022.9.X runtime.
- Indices of objects, sprites, sounds, etc. become mismatched when merging with Void Stranger, so references to them are always obtained with `asset_get_index()`.

# Compiling
- Run the `copier.csx` script on Void Stranger's data.win from the assetscripts folder to copy all the required Void Stranger assets into the project
- From this point you can compile and run the editor on its own
- To merge it into the game, compile and copy the data.win of the editor and run the `merger.csx` script on Void Stranger's data.win
- Make sure to replace the directories at the top of the scripts with your own
