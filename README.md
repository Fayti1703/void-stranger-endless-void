# Endless Void
This repository contains the project file of the Endless Void level editor for Void Stranger, as well as the UndertaleModTool script to merge it into the game.
Very much a work-in-progress. Will eventually send data to a [Voyager](https://github.com/hexfae/voyager) server.

The project is set up like this, as opposed to just a plain UndertaleModTool mod, for several reasons:
- Much faster iteration
- When the game updates, it will be very easy to update with it
- Ability to use animation curves (in a non-painful way)
- Ability to use things that the UndertaleModTool compiler would usually not like
- Ability to open source the project (:

# Things to note about the code
- The project file was generated by GameMaker 2022.9.1.51 and should stay at that version, as Void Stranger was compiled with a 2022.9.X runtime.
- Indices of objects, sprites, sounds, etc. are lost when merging with Void Stranger, so references to them are always obtained with `asset_get_index()`.
